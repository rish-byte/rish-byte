- 👋 Hi, I’m @rish-byte
- 👀 I’m suddenly interested in coding even tho i know absolutely nothing about code or that demonic thing called math.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying business and finance and i hate it here:))))
- 💞️ I’m looking at engineering stuff for reasons i know not of. If this doesn't work sadly, i'll focus on plan B: how to be a stripper.
- 📫 How to reach me...you'll find me under my bed suffering.
